<h2>What is Chokecherry Hiding?</h2>
<p>
  Chokecherry was born with her powers according to the official biography.  She was part
  of the Super Strong Alliance at the age of 21 and stayed with the group for
  five years.  During that time she squared off against LavaGlut.  She defeated LavaGlut,
  but at the cost of her powers.  She retired from mainstream super hero life.

Later, Chokecherry volunteered to be part of the military's soldier enhancement program.
    This program would augment a soldier's natural abilities through Drugs.
     Despite being assured that the procedure was fully researched and tested, it wasn't.
       The experiment skewed Chokecherry's worldview and now she sometimes fights
       for what is right and sometimes sees what is right differently.
We still don't know who she is and what she fights for.
